# Django + React: A technology stack choice example for startups

## Introduction

When you are a founder, CEO, CTO or other stakeholders for a startup company and you are in charge of developing a software product, to be specific, a web application product. The first challenge you face is to choose the proper technoloy stack for the product. A good choice can lead the product to success. However, most non-technical founders are puzzled when presented with so many technology choices for developing their ideas. And they come with a fear that committing to the wrong language or framework will have serious consequences down the road.
Today we will talk about one of the web technoloy stacks which is pretty suitable for startups.

## Criteria

So how can we decide whether the tecnholoy stack is the proper one?

From the product perspetive, we want:

- time: the product can be delivered on time
- cost: the product should be delivered within budget
- quality: the product should maintain high quality
- scope: in fact, we want to develop as many features as possible in a short time as we are startups

From the developer perspective, to acheieve the goal above, a powerful developer community will be required.

## Technology structure for web application

The modern web application is mainly divided into 2 parts:

- client side: the frontend for the application, could be a web app, mobile app or a desktop app
- server side: the backend for the application, host the application, deal with the request and data

The client side and backend side communicate via APIs.

Here are some popular technology stack.

- Frontend technology:
  - basic: html, css, javascript
  - framework: bootstrap(css), vue(js), angular(js), react(js)

- Backend technology:
  - language: javascript, python, ruby, java, .net, php
  - framework: Express(js), Django(python), Rail on ruby(ruby), Spring(java), ASP.NET(.net), Laravel(php)
  - database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

## Django + React

As we have said, today we will talk about the technology stack choice: Django + React
