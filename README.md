        - React
        - React Native
        - Electron
    - database:
        - MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB
    - Deployment
        - Docker for dev
        - Heroku to deploy
        - CI to ensure code quality

3. Setup
    - Backend Setup
    - Frontend Setup
    - Docker Setup
    - Deploy to Heroku

4. To be careful
    - the database structure: especially be careful with `foregin keys`
