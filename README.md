## Index

1. Criteria for choosing a technology stack
    - From product perspective
        - Time to market
        - Cost
        - Quality: focused on user experience
    - From developer perspective
        - Developer Community

2. One example choice
    - backend: Django + Django Rest Framework
    - frontend:
        - React
        - React Native
        - Electron
    - database:
        - MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB
    - Deployment
        - Docker for dev
        - Heroku to deploy
        - CI to ensure code quality

3. Setup
    - Backend Setup
    - Frontend Setup
    - Docker Setup
    - Deploy to Heroku

4. To be careful
    - the database structure: especially be careful with `foregin keys`
    - MongoDB might be a good solution for the early stage startup to verify the idea
